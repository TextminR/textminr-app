## About Project Updates

Now that we've finally managed to finish our project website, we would like to use this opportunity to introduce you to our project updates concept. As you may have noticed, we use simple Markdown files as blog entries to keep you up to date with our project progress. We will publish new pages on a regular basis, so you can follow our progress every other week. We will also use this blog to announce new features and other important news about our project.

## Announcing our first prototypes

Good news! While working on the study chapter of our diploma thesis, we have already developed some prototypes for the visualization of our data. Daniel Lengsteiner, who is currently working on finding appropiate topic modelling algorithms in order to extract topics from text data, has already published his first prototype. You can find it [here](https://dlengsteiner.shinyapps.io/tm-prototype/). It showcases the results of his first experiments with the [LDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) algorithm.

In addition, Andreas SÃ¼nder managed to create a prototype that allows you to experiment with different state-of-the-art language models, which will eventually be used to label the topics extracted by Daniel's algorithm. You can find it [on the HuggingFace platform](https://huggingface.co/spaces/textminr/tl-playground). As of now, it only supports the recently published [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/) model and only one test dataset, but we will enhance it with more models, datasets and prompts in the near future.
